Weather prediction, also known as weather forecasting, is the process of estimating the state of the atmosphere at a specific location for a given period in the future. It involves analyzing current atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, and humidity. Meteorologists use computer models that simulate the behavior of the atmosphere to make predictions about future weather conditions. While short-term forecasts (up to a few days) are generally more accurate, long-term predictions involve greater uncertainties. Advances in technology, satellite observations, and numerical modeling have improved the accuracy of weather predictions over time.
