1. Install Library File
   * Add TRIGGER_LIBRARY to path "C:\Users\Documents\Arduino\libraries"
   * Open your Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. The Library Manager should open.
   * Search for “DHT” in the Search box and install the DHT library from Adafruit.
   *After installing the DHT library from Adafruit, type “Adafruit Unified Sensor” in the search box. Scroll down to find the library and install it.
   * After installing the libraries, restart your Arduino IDE

2. Setting the Arduino IDE
    * Change the WIFi credentials
    * Now, upload the code and analyze the data generated.

3. Output
